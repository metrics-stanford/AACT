The code can be used to do the following: return the number of studies that satisfy a specific condition, return the NCT number for studies that meet a certain condition, return NCT numbers and intervention type for studies given either a list of id’s or certain conditional statements, return NCT numbers and conditions given either a list of id’s or certain conditional statements, and return NCT numbers and MeSH headings given either a list of id’s or certain conditional statements.
